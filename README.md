## Introduction
Weather data have been collected from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/). We used the integrated [GHCN-Daily](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description) database of daily climate summaries from stations across the globe, which mean variables such as the minimum and maximum temperatures, the total precipitations, and so on.
We downloaded a station list and used it to locate temperature data for cities. We managed missing values and smoothed time series in order to enhance the information out of the noise. Finally, we created some visualisations of daily temperatures.
